# @ppym/registry

*Build Python applications the Node way.*

**[ppy]** is kind of a Node.js clone: An engine based on Python that lays the
foundation for loading Python modules resolved from actual filenames with a
`require()` function.

This is the **ppy package registry** which stores packages and allows the
ppy package manager **ppym** to find and download dependencies.
